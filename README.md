# Interpolation-for-Finance
Interpolations are an area of study in Scientific Computing. Interpolation is a method of deriving a simple function from the given discrete data set such that the function passes through the provided data points. This helps to determine the data points in between the given data ones. This method is always needed to compute the value of a function for an
intermediate value of the independent function. In short, interpolation is a process of determining the unknown values that lie in between the known data points.
In this project, the aim is to innovatively use interpolation in some real-world applications. Therefore, I have used two different interpolation techniques, namely, Newton Forward Interpolation and Cubic Spline Interpolation in the field of Finance.

❖ The former is used to make a system which would help us to trade the SBI stock with the maximum possible profit. This system can be used by the people participating in the share market.(Files involved- sbi.csv, newton.py, Newton_1%brokerage.py, Newton_2%brokerage.py)

❖ Whereas the latter is used to make a system which would help the investors to make a smart decision by providing estimated daily continuous yield curve & instantaneous forward rate curve for a Q1 of January 2020. This system can be used by the people participating in the bond market.(Files involved- Cubic_Spline.xlsx, m.xlsx, SplineInterpolation.py and SplineInterpolation.ipynb)
